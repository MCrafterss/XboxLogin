# XboxLogin
Allow only  xbox signed in players to join!

# Info

Allowing xbox players, will break alot of things, such as names will contain "spaces". So you"ll need to re-write most of the plugins to support username with spaces. But again all this plugin will do is allow Xbox players only to join. You"ll be able to customized the kick messages ect ect. If you encounter any issues. Please "do" open a issue :) 


# Status

Still building, we"ll let you know when theres a beta-release!

~ I don't think this is needed no more, since Genisys already have it working :)
